If you are creating new .NET microservices for the cloud, modernizing existing applications for the cloud, or just plain moving apps to containers, Steeltoe is here to make things much easier. There is a list of things every microservice on a cloud platform should be good at. Unlike IIS on virtual machines an application running in a container is ephemeral - it could be run here today or there tomorrow.
Microservices need to be resilient to this change but developers shouldn’t spend loads of time coding for this.

The Steeltoe project aims to help you get the most out of the cloud, with very little code. By taking advantage of .NET Core’s dependency injection and middleware pipeline, it gives developers instant best practices. Steeltoe also helps legacy .NET Framework apps become instantly modern and make best friends with containers.
